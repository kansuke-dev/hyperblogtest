Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. I'm your older brother, Mike, and I was stepped over! If anything in this life is certain, if history has taught us anything, it is that you can kill anyone. You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me? This one time, this one time I'll let you ask me about my affairs. We're both part of the same hypocrisy, senator, but never think it applies to my family.

Do me this favor. I won't forget it. Ask your friends in the neighborhood about me. They'll tell you I know how to return a favor. It's not personal. It's business. My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator. I don't like violence, Tom. I'm a businessman; blood is a big expense.

It's a Sicilian message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes. What's the matter with you? Is this what you've become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries like a woman? "Oh, what do I do? What do I do?" What is that nonsense? Ridiculous! Te salut, Don Corleone. Mr Corleone is Johnny Fontane's godfather. Now Italians regard that as a very close, a very sacred religious relationship. My father taught me many things here - he taught me in this room. He taught me: keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.

I don't feel I have to wipe everybody out, Tom. Just my enemies. Michael, you never told me you knew Johnny Fontane! Fredo, you're my older brother, and I love you. But don't ever take sides with anyone against the Family again. Ever. I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart. You broke my heart! When they come... they come at what you love
